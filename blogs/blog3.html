    <h1>Pragmatic Programmer: Chapter 2</h1>
    <h4>Don't Repeat Yourself</h4>
    <p>
        This section discusses the issues with repeating code.  When you repeat code and you tweak a section
        of one of the code sections you have to change every instance of that code.  It is easy to miss an 
        instance but if you use functions it is much easier to prevent errors when tweaking the program.
    </p>
    <h4>Orthogonality</h4>
    <p>
        This is about making sure every operation our algorithm does doesn't change anything that the algorithm 
        has no business changing.  This is important for the same reason that the helicopter controls were 
        important, except arguably less severe depending on the situation.
    </p>
    <h4>Prototyping</h4>
    <p>
        I learned here that it is not unheard of to prototype an application in a high level language like Visual 
        Basic.  Having learned programming in visual basic, I can see why that is a thing because it is an 
        incredibly simple language that is easy to get something up and running in.
