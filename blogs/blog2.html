    <h1>Pragmatic Programmer: Chapter 1</h1>
    <h4>Don't live with broken windows</h4>
    <p>I found this interesting because it is true but I never really noticed it.  Once one thing breaks it is
        much easier to just let other things break without worrying about them.  I experience this with my car
        all the time.  It used to be in good condition, but little things keep breaking so they stopped mattering as
        much, and the big things don't seem so big anymore when you add it to the list of broken parts, so why worry
        about fixing it now?  Obviously it is usually easier to fix a broken program feature than a car (a lot cheaper
        too), but the point made is very true.</p>
    <h4>The Stone Soup</h4>
    <p>This is interesting and important because it demonstrates a good way to tackle a large problem with many
        components with a group of people and their individual skills or attributes.  It also points out the problem
        people have with focusing on one thing while they are being used for another.</p>
    <h4>The Rest of the Chapter</h4>
    <p>The rest of the chapter talks about keeping your skills in top shape by constantly learning new languages and
        exposing yourself to new things.  It also talks about how to balance features and polishing with time frames and
        expectations.  This is important because sometimes there isn't enough time to completely polish the program or
        make every feature as perfect as it could be.  The book states that most users are happier with a working version
        now and a full-featured version later than just a full-featured version later.  This is also useful for
        planning features based on importance.  You should already have an idea of each feature's importance, but
        feedback will make it much easier to plan for the future.</p>
