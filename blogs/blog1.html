    <h1>What Software Engineering means to me.</h1>
    <p>Software engineering is the art and science of designing, building, and maintaining software.  To me it is about
    taking an idea you have or a program that would make a task easier to complete and writing it.  Doing this, you
    express yourself, usually challenge yourself (and by extension learn something new), and you get to look at the
    finished product and know that you created it and it is yours.  The program can be as correct or wrong as you the
    programmer want, because YOU wrote it.  With this new knowledge you gained from experimenting with the last project
    you can extend even farther and and farther and continue learning new things.</p>
