    <h1>Mythical Man Month</h1>
    <p>
      An interesting point I noticed was when the author said "The incompleteness and inconsitencies of our ideas become clear only
      during implementation".  I never really thought about this until now, but it is true in my experiences.  It is easy to plan
      in your head what the program will do, how you will make it, and how each feature is implemented.  But when it comes to
      implementing these features, you usually run into an unexpected hurdle along the way.

      The points made about how adding people to the project that was scheduled for 4 months taking longer is interesting.  I hadn't
      even thought about the training aspect when visualizing the problem.  Training new people or catching them up to what is going
      on always takes time, so rather than add more people and waste more time training than working, just work on the project at hand.
      Adding people is also bad because of the increased amount and importance of communication.  If people can't communicate effectively
      then the whole group will suffer because of it.
