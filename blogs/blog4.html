    <h1>Pragmatic Programmer: Chapter 3</h1>
    <h4>Tools</h4>
    <p>
        This section discusses the importance of using a good IDE instead of a plain text editor.
        This is interesting to me because I can never seem to get IntelliJ to work properly or be light
        enough to be practical.  I mostly use Visual Studio Code to write, but intelliJ or bash to test.
        VSCode is nice because it has nice git integration.
    </p>
    <h4>Debugging</h4>
    <p>
        Debugging is useful because it helps you find miniscule errors in your code. Breakpoints are very
        helpful when it comes to finding conversion errors in piglatin and math errors in the masterlock
         assignment we had in Languages and Automata.
