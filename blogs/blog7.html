    <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <h3>Coding Practices</h3>
            <p>
                This section refers to coding defensively and not trying to write perfect code.  
                I like this because coding defensively is important because you need to account for errors 
                that the user can make so that they can be handled properly without breaking everything resulting 
                in late night calls from your manager asking why things are broken for the poor old lady that 
                had the misfortune of hitting that one single error that you didn't account for when you were 
                tracing your code.  This goes along with the inability to write perfect code, because if you 
                could write perfect code you would never get that phone call.
            </p>
        <h3>Exceptions</h3>
            <p>
                These sections pertain to errors that your program can have.  These are important because 
                you need to handle errors in your code.  Crashing is fine when you are in the process of 
                writing, but you need to handle those exceptions in the final release version.
            </p>
        <h3>Resource Management</h3>
            <p>
                This section talks about deallocating the memory you use.  This is important because I have 
                experienced first hand what can happen.  I broke something in a project and ended up with a 
                60gb text file because something wasnt closed properly or at all.
